Comic Easel allows you to post webcomics to your theme.

== Description ==

Comic Easel is a plugin that allows you to incorporate webcomics into your existing WordPress theme.

[WARNING] This plugin is currently - In Developement


There are other "action" area's that you can put into your theme, not just the comic-area.  Those are being documented and will be available this coming week.

== Installation ==

* Add the plugin, activate it.
* Modify your theme adding `<?php do_action('comic-area'); ?>` in a position where to display the comic, generally it should be right above the #content and under the menu bar.
